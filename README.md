# **Face Recognition for Raspberry Pi**
## This is my code for using [face-recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) on Raspberry Pi
### The whole struggle is with getting dlib installed correctly on the chip
### So please take a look at the requirements file.
### Those are the steps I needed to take to install dlib on my pi in 2021.
### Note that the steps may differ and change with time.
